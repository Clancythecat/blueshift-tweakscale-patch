# blueshift-tweakscale-patch

this patch makes almost all parts scalable
And makes warp drive performance scale with volume
(diminishing returns with added warp capacity still apply)

It is highly recommended you use this tweakscale patch for waterfall https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScaleCompanion_Frameworks
